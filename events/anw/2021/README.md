Instructions
------------

You can open the c2p file using the [Capture](https://www.capture.se/) software which has a free to download demo.
I'm using the 2019 version but the show file should open in the newer version just fine.

You can open the shw file using [MagicQ](https://chamsyslighting.com/products/magicq) which also offers a free demo version.

If you're confused how to use them both have wonderful video tutorial series and extensive manuals available.
I'm happy to answer show file related questions and will try to add an FAQ here as people have them.

FAQ
---

### How do I get MagicQ to output to Capture?

There is a tutorial available on [using Capture with MagicQ](https://www.capture.se/Portals/0/DemoPacks/ChamSys_Instructions.pdf).
The show uses the first 8 universes so be sure to enable them.

### How do I get to all the different windows you were using, I only have one monitor?

LAYOUT 1 is the programmer, LAYOUT 2 is the execute window and LAYOUT 3 is the plot view.
We used 3 monitors at con to show all the different windows so Layout 1 may pop up additional windows.
If you don't want them, close em out and hit RECORD then LAYOUT 1.

### Not all the faders/buttons we used at con are showing up, where are they?

We used a PC wing and an extra wing to run the show, you can access the cue stacks on the extra wing from the PLAYBACK button.
You may want to copy them over to page two on the main playbacks for easier access.

### What does everything do?

Most stuff should be labeled with what it does, if in doubt push a button and see what happens.
For the main playback, the buttons at the top have been remapped to the first execute page and are color flashes.
The main playback faders are all stage related lighting and specials, the last is a speed master.
On the execute page, the cues to the right of (Chases) will change the active cue on playback 4 of the extra wing.
On the execute page, the cues to the right of (Patterns) will change the active cues on playbacks 1 - 3 of the extra wing.
On the extra wing playbacks 5 - 9 are intensity masters for different fixture types.
Everything else should be fairly self explanatory, if you still don't know feel free to ask me.

### How can I run lights at a convention?

Sign up to volunteer!
If you're not able to, then try to come by the tech table during the evening dances.
At both BLFC and ANW I love teaching people how to run the lights.
You may just get a special ribbon out of it too ;)
