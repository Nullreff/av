# AV

This repository is my attempt at organizing all the audio/visual work myself and others have done over the years.

* `events/` - Documents, showfiles and resources from various events.
* `rust-magicq/` - Attempt at reverse engineering the MagicQ showfile format and creating a rust library for reading/writing it.
* `show/` - Common files used for working with MagicQ.

## Contributions

If you have files from a show you did and think others might find them useful feel free to open a pull request or message me directly.
Ideally I'd just like to accept stuff from events and projects myself or friends are personally involved in.
Please make sure that it's ok for you to openly share stuff, don't leak stuff from closed productions.
